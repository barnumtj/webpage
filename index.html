    <img id=img1 src="file:///Users/kaceehiggins/Desktop/Documents/BootCamp/basic-portfolio/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-03%20at%202.38.17%20PM.png" alt="picture of me">

    <p class="aboutme1">I was born and raised in the great state of Nebraska.  I lived there my whole life up until about 6 months ago.  While in Nebraska I participated 
        in track and basketball throughout high school.  I continued to run track in college which was a great experience for me and taught me many things.  After 
        leaving college I wasn't sure what my next step was and moved back home.  During these years I worked several jobs including serving at restaurants and
        working for Frito-Lay.  After realizing I didn't enjoy these type of jobs I have now decided to pursue a career in web development.
    </p>
    
    <p class="aboutme1">I have several hobbies that include fishing, sports, gaming, and working out.  I started fishing a couple years ago and have been 
        obsessed ever since.  My favorite sports teams include the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Kansas City Chiefs, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Sporting KC.
        When it comes to gaming I enjoy first person shooters and sports games.  If I'm not doing one of the three things above then I am most likely
        working out.  I find it to be not only great for my physical health but my mental health.
